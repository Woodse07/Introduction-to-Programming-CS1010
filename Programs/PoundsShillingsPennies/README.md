Write a program which takes in amounts of old Sterling pounds, shillings and pennies and converts it to modern pounds and pennies.<b/>
Assume:<b/>
1 old penny = 67 new pennies (due to inflation!)<b/>
1 old shilling = 12 old pennies<b/>
1 old pound = 20 old shillings<b/>
1 new pound = 100 new pennies<b/>
 
e.g.<b/>
  1 old pound, 0 old shilling and 0 old pence = £160.80<b/>
 0 old pound, 1 old shilling and 0 old pence = £8.04<b/>
 0 old pound, 0 old shilling and 1 old pence = £0.67<b/>
 3 old pound, 2 old shilling and 5 old pence = £501.83<b/>
