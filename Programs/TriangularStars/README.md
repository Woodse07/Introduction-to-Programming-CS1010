#### A “star number”, s, is a number defined by the formula:  s = 6n(n-1) + 1     where n is the index of the star number.  Thus the star numbers are:   1, 13, 37, 73, 121, 181, 253, …<br/>
#### A “triangle number”, t, is the sum of the numbers from 1 to n:   t = 1 + 2 + … + (n-1) + n.  Thus the triangle numbers are:  1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, …<br/>
Write a Java application that produces a list of all the values of type int that are simultaneously star numbers and triangle numbers.  As part of this problem you must write and use the following functions:<br/>
An isStarNumber() routine which determines if the passed number is a star number or not.<br/>
A determineStarNumber() function which returns the star number of a passed index (i.e. value of n) OR a determineTriangleNumber() function which returns the triangle number for a passed index (i.e. value of n)<br/>
