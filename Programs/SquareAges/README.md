#### The mathematician Augustus De Morgan was aged 43 in the year 1849AD.  This is interesting because 43 squared is 1849, ie, in 1849 his age was the square root of the year.<br />
#### Given that no person has ever lived longer than 123 years (and assuming that no one ever will), write a Java application that will determine if it is possible that anyone who is alive today is, has ever been, or will ever be alive in a year that is the square of their age.<br />
If it is possible, your program should print out the years in which it happens and the ages that the people concerned will have in those years.<br />
Note: This question is Q.1 from the CS1011 exam paper in May 2010<br />
Hint: It is strongly recommended that you first write a program which writes out the square of each possible age (from 0 to 123).  Then you can adapt this program and restrict the output to those which ages and years satisfy the question...<br />
